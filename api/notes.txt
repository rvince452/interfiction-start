Issue - User and World have a relationshipt through user id. But if I create a world with 
a user id that doesn't exist, there is  no error. When I look at that World, the user id is filled
but the User object is not. After I enter the user then the relationships work.

User access design.
    World has a userId which is the 'author'
    Game has a userId which is the 'player'
    But each REST call, should have an associated userId of the person making the call.
        We put that in the header under user_token
        For now, it is straight text and the user = user_token
