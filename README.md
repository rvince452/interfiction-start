# interfiction-start
This is the start of my ***Interfiction*** project. The general purpose is to implement an interactive fiction website.

## Technologies
Programming language would be Python as I love Python. The website would be as simple as positive and leverage a backend REST API (both in Python)
Planning to host/deploy to AWS, perhaps Lightsail instance.

## Goals
The interactive fiction model should be that of a [Game Book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamebook) - the player should be able to ***easily*** make choices and decisions without tedious typing and searching. That is the player experience. Obviously the experience for writing a new game would be more involed but again simplicity is the goal.
